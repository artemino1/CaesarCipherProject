# Caesar Cipher Project

This project demonstrates the Caesar Cipher, a basic encryption technique used in cryptography. The script can encrypt and decrypt messages using a specified shift value. For example, with a shift of 3, **A** would be encrypted to **D**, **B** to **E**, and so on.

## Language used

Bash, Python

## Environment used

Linux

## Program walk-through

1. We created a new directory for our project in the terminal on our VM and initialized a new Git repository:

2. Then we crafted a Python file `caesar_cipher.py`.

3. Now let's try different strings and shift values to ensure the encryption and decryption functions work as expected.
